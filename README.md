Welcome!

This place is used for maintenance of the website
[www.epsig.nl](https://www.epsig.nl/)

In the folder `pages` you find a copy of the current website.

The site is generated using a Perl script,
with a lot of data in the script.
Currently busy (see the issues) to split the script from the data.
Data now goes in csv and xml.

After this splitting is done,
the Perl script and the data will be become open source.

And another plan is to replace Perl by Python or Julia.
